# LanguagePatternAnalysis

Hello ! This is a language pattern analysis notebook I made to try to come up with different ideas and improve my algorithm complexity optimization (and sorry for the absolute blasphemy of a naming convention I'm using, if you manage to figure out what a variable is supposed to mean then that makes one of us)

I. Starts, endings and middles

Finding the most common 3,4,5-grams that start, end or are within words

II. Succession matrix

A matrix representing which letters are most likely to follow each other

III. Incidence matrix

A matrix that represents which letters are most likely to be in the same word

IV. Palindromes, anagrams, etc

A list of different alphabetical properties

Here is the link to download the file used for this study, note than any text file with words separated by linebreaks will work, so this study works in any language :
